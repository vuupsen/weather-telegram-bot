# weather-telegram-bot
This is my first repository. You can use this incredibly complex project that I worked hard on for 5 minutes.

In the config.py, you must specify the token of your telegram bot and the api_key. 
I used OpenWeather API to get weather data, so you must register an account on https://openweathermap.org and get the API key (it's free).
